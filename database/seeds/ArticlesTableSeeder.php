             <p>Quilting started as a social activity. Farm wives got together when they weren\'t performing chores. They made bed coverings, curtains, petticoats and other articles. Patchwork was a result of a fabric shortage. Old items would be woven into a single fabric, producing wondrous designs. That form has become everything from an expression of art to a charitable statement.</p>
<p>Today quilting is as much a hobby for enjoyment as it is a professional endeavor. Whether for fun or profit, quilting is a great opportunity to create. Nothing has made these projects easier than the quilting sewing machine.</p>
<h2 itemprop="hasPart about">Types of Quilting</h2>
<p>Patchwork, or pieced, quilting is only one form of the art, usually the one most of us begin with. Most quilters tend to stay within traditional patterns that include blocks of rectangles and squares, rarely stepping outside of those shapes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a quilting sewing machine leads to venturing into other styles, especially if one utilizes a more advanced model that allows for easy design. Postage stamp quilting consists of squaring, but small rows of objects. There is also the more difficult appliqué process that requires shapes on backgrounds that promise to create a stunning view. Paper piercing is developed when the quilter stitches fabric to a paper foundation. Used as guides, the quilter can block the entire quilt, constructing all sorts of objects and shapes.</p>
<h2 itemprop="hasPart about">The Growth and Beauty of Free Motion Quilting</h2>
<p>Free motion quilting has grown in popularity among quilters. This is an advanced stitch process where the sewing machine uses a darning foot as opposed to its feed dogs. This lets the fabric move freely with the quilter carefully feeding the fabric. This requires a steady hand as even an experienced quilter can easily disrupt the stitch process.</p>
<p>Free motion will produce an incredible design as it resembles embroidery done in a hand sewn fashion but with the convenience of modern technology. In the age of quilting sewing machines that can computer generate designs, old school quilters appreciate the greater control of the patterns free motion can put into their quilting.</p>
<p>Some quilting sewing machines make for a better range of free motion. There are also courses that can help the quilter develop the steady touch this process requires.</p>
<h2 itemprop="hasPart about">How to Select Quilting Sewing Machines</h2>
